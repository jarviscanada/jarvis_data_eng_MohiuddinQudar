# Mohiuddin Md Abdul Qudar . Jarvis Consulting

I received my master's degree at Lakehead university,  in computer science, with a focus on applied machine learning and deep learning techniques to address a variety of business-related issues. I have worked as a research data analyst with Lakehead University. I have worked with various machine learning and deep learning models as a data researcher. I have over 7 years of working experience with Python, SQL(ETL), Microsoft Excel, and knowledge related to data analysis, reporting, analytics, and data modeling.

My research work has been recognized and published in top peer-reviewed journals such as Expert Systems with Applications and IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society. I have developed a transformer-based natural language model to carry out text analysis for Twitter, which can be used for gathering customer insights about a product from online reviews or detect a pandemic in its early stages. This language model has outperformed all other language models for analyzing tweets.

## Highlighted Projects
Developed a novel opinion mining system called ONSET, enabling language models to be fine tune without using large amounts of training data. Developed using an unsupervised learning approach to label aspects using topic modeling and then using semi-supervised learning with data augmentation. This model can also be used as a recommendation or ranking system. This project has been submitted to a peer-reviewed conference, which is currently under review.


Introduced two transformer based models, TweetBERT, which are domain-specific language presentation models pre-trained on millions of Twitter data (tweets). Evaluated and compared 12 BERT models on 31 different datasets. The results validated the hypothesis that continuously training language models on very large Twitter datasets helps to achieve better performance on Twitter datasets. This project has been submitted in a reputed journal, which is currently under review.

Developed LSTM model for time-series analysis and forecasting.
 
Carried out a survey on various types of language models that helped to gained strong knowledge on transformer based models and on neural network architectures such as RNN, CNN, and GAN.

Developed a model for detecting emotions using EEG dataset. This model was developed by converting EEG instances into image format and then using autoencoder and data augmentation.

Created a clustering model using machine learning algorithm for selecting features and classification using sequential forward selection with Naive Bayes.

Developed sequential model for text simplification using semantic similarity.  

Developed a non linear regression model for text analysis.


Designed a link prediction neural network-based framework similar to the Katz index, SimRank and rooted PageRank. Experiment conducted using real-life data sets consisting of over 3,000,000 combined unique tweets and over 250,000 combined unique hashtags. A graph analysis was carried out and Tableau software was used for data cleaning. This research work has been accepted for publication as a book chapter in Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM).
